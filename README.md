This repository contain the data and MATLAB code for the paper :

Descripotion:

Two algorithms are applied to disrupt complex network??
First Algorithm, 

To run the Laplacian Algorithm (Run L.m), use the following matlab command line:
"[Cut,S0]=L(ComplexNetwork,ProteinID,All_name_Proteins);"
Input:
ComplexNetwork:  complex network (tab delimited MAT-File with n columns and n row, for n vertices).
ProteinID:    the nodes of network (you can use the no. of selected proteins or tab delimited MAT-File with n rows).
All_name_Proteins: The name of Proteins (tab detimited MAT-File with n names of all proteins).

Output:

Cut: The name of selected proteins.

S0= The no. of selected proteins.

In addition, We present a ComplexNetwork related to biological process of Sars_Covid-2 and
ProteinIDrelated to its nodes from all proteins in Example.mat file.
